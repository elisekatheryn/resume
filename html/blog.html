                Instagram is a platform where users can post pictures and videos to share messages with their friends and followers. While this seems simple, instagram has become more complicated overtime. Users have become lost in the details of how many followers, likes, and interaction they get from the receivers of their content. What initially was a place to share your life, has become a preview of only you at your best. The question is, how do you avoid falling into this pattern and instead bring authenticity to your account? 
<br><br>
Effects of Authenticity: 
<br><br>
	It is first important to understand the purpose of being genuine on social media and the effects it has. Prior to Instagram, platforms such as Facebook created  <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.13013/892" target="_blank"> <u>social comparison</u></a> groups that mainly consist of your friends and family. In these groups, you compare yourself to others who are similar to you in a variety of ways. However, Instagram enlarged users' social comparison group to include strangers and more specifically, celebrities, who have significantly different demographics. (Dion) This means that your feed now consists of people who have a higher social status and more money. Differences in circumstances lead to unrealistic comparisons to others lives and in return can affect self esteem and overall satisfaction of life. 
<br><br>
How Can You Change: 

<br><br>
	Authenticity comes from the individual choosing to appear real on instagram. Oftentimes, users disclose information about their life to make themselves look more appealing to their followers. Posting only the best of their day. This can include exclusively sharing positive experiences such as vacations, professional images, or posed and preplanned photos while leaving out the not as pretty side of their day. While it may seem overwhelming, there are several ways to overcome these issues. 
<br><br>
One way could be the type of content you put out. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444819891699?casa_token=57BUBoGh8foAAAAA%3A8yzIiZTFSbTkvfevEj-wpPpvDTn1jGr55E6nqxrs2JnbXdffGyc3wCiWeAE69SJJw7A3l-fx3WSEiAamz" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> study done by Josie Read, participants described raw through three ways: (1) posting the body raw, (2) storying the everyday and (3) ‘real talk’ about topics such as body image and mental health. Posting more about your everyday life can help followers get a glimpse of what your life is actually like. Also, showing that you also face challenges such as body image and mental health can help followers relate to you instead of keeping you on a pedestal for having a perfect life. This allows for more interconnectivity between followers and as a result, relationships start to flourish. 
<br><br>
Another way to be more authentic is by posting raw content. Oftentimes, young adults focus on sharing “instagram worthy” pictures. The gruesome process of taking hundreds of pictures has users obsessed with finding the perfect picture to post. Even candid pictures are often posed and don’t show the reality of the situation. It is common for people to edit and add filters to their photos to change their appearance. Instead, posting unedited pictures of yourself can help others perceive the real you and in return make your social media more genuine.

 A crucial aspect to Instagram is the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221086235" target="_blank"><u>feedback</u></a> from peers and how it affects the user. The number of likes a person gets is how they evaluate their standing among peers. A positive feedback, increase in likes, can increase self esteem, but a negative or lack of feedback results in feelings of disapproval, disappointment, and unacceptance. This can lead to the user deleting their post, decrease the amount of content they share and become less active on their posting. 
<br><br>
Another way is to change how you post content. Instagram has multiple options that allow you to share messages differently to fit the prevalent need. The original post has higher visibility and persistence, meaning more people see it and is more permanent. However, stories were developed that allow users to post content that disappears after 24 hours and is not permanently on their feed. This gives users the option to post events as they unfold with less careful planning. Stories feature allows for self-presentation that is thought of to be more authentic and show more of their real life. 
<br><br>
While it may seem overwhelming, being genuine on instagram starts with you. Following these tips will help you have a more authentic mindset and wholesome intention when creating content to post online. Consequently, this will help others follow in your example and together make a difference in spreading more positivity. Becoming genuine on instagram can increase interconnectivity and build relationships while being our true selves
